# Data-Analytics-Lecture-Materials-Redi
A collection of teaching materials that I created at the class `Data Analytics with Python` at ReDI School.

It includes slides together with Jupyter notebooks for practices and examples.

You can find all the teaching materials also from other teachers: https://github.com/ReDI-School/data-analytics.
